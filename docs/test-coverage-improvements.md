# Test Coverage Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the test coverage improvements made to the Spring PetClinic application. Two new test classes were added to increase test coverage for previously untested components.

## New Test Classes

### 1. PetClinicRuntimeHintsTests
**File:** `src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/PetClinicRuntimeHintsTests.java`

This test class verifies the functionality of the `PetClinicRuntimeHints` class, which is responsible for registering runtime hints for resources and serialization types. The test class includes:

- `shouldRegisterResourcePatterns()`: Tests that specific resource patterns (db/*, messages/*, mysql-default-conf) are correctly registered in the RuntimeHints.
- `shouldRegisterSerializationTypes()`: Tests that no exceptions are thrown when registering serialization types for `BaseEntity`, `Person`, and `Vet` classes.

### 2. PetClinicApplicationTests
**File:** `src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/PetClinicApplicationTests.java`

This test class verifies that the Spring Boot application context loads correctly. It includes:

- `contextLoads()`: A simple test that will fail if the application context cannot be loaded properly. This ensures that the main application class `PetClinicApplication` and its configuration are working correctly.

## Benefits

These new test classes provide the following benefits:

1. **Increased Test Coverage**: Previously untested components now have test coverage, reducing the risk of undetected issues.
2. **Verification of Critical Components**: The tests verify that critical components like runtime hints registration and application context loading work correctly.
3. **Documentation Through Tests**: The tests serve as documentation for how these components are expected to function.

## Validation

All tests have been executed and passed successfully without any Checkstyle violations, confirming the correctness of the implementation.
